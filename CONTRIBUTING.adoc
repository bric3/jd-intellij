= Contributing

This plugin needs your contribution.

The following topic in particular may require some attention:

IntelliJ IDEA integration::
* IJ is always improving and changing a few things that may break plugins
* User experience improvements
* New ideas or integration may prove useful

JD-Core support::
So actually this area is not really directly related to _jd-intellij_ but to the engine that perform the decompilation, JD-Core.
It can be improved, e.g. in no particular order :
* Latest Java language features like records, switch expressions, etc
* Decompiler configuration like Unicode escaping, default constructor



== Development

.First steps
The plugin uses the new https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin[Gradle]
based infrastructure to build plugins.
Currently, the target is IntelliJ 2021.1.

. Clone from GitHub
. Import it on IntelliJ IDEA from the `build.gradle` project descriptor
. Run the new configuration

.Building it
So, to create the plugin zip archive (with the custom repository file) in the
`deploy` folder, enter the following at root of the project :

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew buildPlugin
----

.Run or debug
Using gradle it's just as easy as entering:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew runIde
----

To debug in IntelliJ just launch with debugger this task from the gradle panel.
