https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-core[JD-Core] is the engine that powers the decompilation.


== Installation

The plugin is available on the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7100[JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Marketplace], to install it go to the _Settings_ dialog window &gt; _Plugins_ pane &gt;
_Browse Repositories_ dialog window, then search for _Java Decompiler_.

_If you are an early adopter you might want to try the EAPs channel, simply add the following `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/list?channel=eap&pluginId=7100` plugin repository URL_

== Warning

This plugin is maintained as a best effort, if you find bug it's likely this project, or https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-core[JD-Core] would welcome your contributions.

There's several reasons:

- lack of spare time (kids family, other hobbies, other...),
- IJ now ships with a fairly decent decompiler within https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/#built-in-tools[IntelliJ IDEA itself]
(even the https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html[community version]).
It is based on a fork of Fernflower (See https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/java-decompiler[here]).
