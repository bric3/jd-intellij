== Presentation

*JD-IntelliJ* is a plug-in for *IntelliJ IDEA*, initiated by *Brice Dutheil*.
It uses the *Java Decompiler* binaries It allows you to display all the Java sources during your debugging process, even if you do not have them all.
Currently, the project is under development.

Your contributions are welcome.

Also note that it is possible to decompile jars/classes with *JD-GUI* (can be found on the official site).

== Warning

This plugin is currently partly maintained, due to lack of time and, due to the availability of a decompiler within https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/#built-in-tools[IntelliJ IDEA itself]
(even the https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html[community version]).

IntelliJ IDEA's decompiler is based on a fork of Fernflower (See https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/java-decompiler[here]).

== Notes

It is the official https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-core[*Java Decompiler*] plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

Last but not the least, all the credit for decompilation stuff must go to
*Emmanuel Dupuy*, who is the author of Java Decompiler.
